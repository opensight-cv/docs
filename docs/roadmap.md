OpenSight is still very much an active project. You can see our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ckT7JuO8/opensight) for a full list of everything we plan to do in the near future.

Here's some of the highlights:

* Contour Filtering functions (such as area, aspect ratio, fullness, count)
* Static IP networking settings
* H.264 CameraServer with Shuffleboard plugin
* Basic conditional logic functions
* GPIO control module

If you would like to help out with any of these features or you have any feedback whatsoever, please join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hPqpdsK)! We would love to hear your feedback in the #feedback channel. If you are interested in contributing, say so and any preference as to what to work on in #general and we will get you set up as soon as possible.
